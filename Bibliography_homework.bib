  abstract = {Observational and experimental evidence suggests that it is important to explicitly account for the fluidized flow regime in avalanche hazard mapping due to its high mobility, intermediate density and high velocity. We explore the differences from conventional runout modelling by implementing an extension of the Norem\textendash Irgens\textendash Schieldrop (NIS) rheology in a simple mass-point model. When the dispersive stresses and the excess pore pressure equal the overburden pressure, the flow height increases and the density diminishes until a new equilibrium is reached, determined by the different density dependencies of the two parameters of the dispersive stresses. Fluidization requires sufficiently steep terrain; when it occurs it leads to substantially higher velocities than compared to the dense-flow regime. The model parameters are strongly constrained by their physical meaning and vary little between widely different avalanches. However, in all test cases we obtained better agreement between simulated and observed runout distances and pressure effects than with conventional models.},

  abstract = {This paper studies entrainment phenomenon in debris flows using full flow (non-depth-averaged) equations and an Incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (ISPH) method. A viscoplastic constitutive relationship is adopted for both the overlying fluid and bed material. Collapse of a two-dimensional dry granular column on a horizontal bed consisting of entrainable dry granular material is considered as a benchmark problem. The adopted ISPH method for simulation of collapse over rigid and entrainable beds is validated using available numerical and experimental data. To quantify the effects of entrainment on dynamics of flow, the initial aspect ratio of granular column (a) is varied and the variations in momentum and energy of moving materials are investigated.},

  abstract = {A new hybrid discrete\textendash continuum numerical approach that explores the key advantages of both discrete and continuum approaches is proposed to model unsaturated seepage flows through porous media. In contrast to existing approaches where a porous medium is often represented by a continuum medium or required a background mesh, the proposed approach explicitly exploits the discrete contact network formed by an assembly of discrete solid particles. Each solid particle is assumed to occupy an equivalent-continuum space, over which the governing equations for unsaturated seepage flow are derived. These governing equations are then discretised and solved on the discrete contact network through a new numerical procedure that links micro-diffusivity to the macro-one. Thanks to this concept, the proposed approach is capable of describing the nature of flow in unsaturated porous media at the microscale level. This unique feature also enables the proposed approach to naturally simulate the water flow through the heterogeneous porous media without any ad hoc treatments. In this paper, the mathematical concept of the proposed approach together with its implementation features and performances for a rigid porous media is presented and discussed. The focus is placed on its application to the discrete element method (DEM), although the proposed concept, in general, can be applied to any other methods possessing similar features.},

  abstract = {Debris flows devastate downstream regions with large impulsive forces resulting from the significant increase in volume due to the erosion during their rapid movement. As this increase in volume is primarily derived from the sediment bed, sediment bed erosion characteristics determine the sediment transport rate and the corresponding severity degree. This study presents a coupled model based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element method (DEM) to simulate sediment bed erosion by viscous shear flow at various shear flow velocities. DEM is adopted to simulate the granular bed particles, and CFD is employed to model the shear flow (water and mudflows). The numerical model was verified by comparing the erosion formula and critical erosion shear stress with a pre-existing laboratory experiment. The erosion characteristics of the sediment bed were investigated from macro and micro perspectives. A sediment bed can be divided into four layers from top to bottom: saltating layer, rolling layer, creeping layer, and static layer. The depth profile of the average particle velocity obeyed a linear distribution in the rolling layer, and the velocity was approximately zero in the bottom layer. Dynamic information on the particle loss, trajectory, velocity, and principal stresses was recorded. Velocity traces demonstrated significant fluctuations with several isolated peaks, and the velocity variable displayed Gaussian distributions in the streamwise and vertical direction. The influence of the shear velocity on the drag force and sediment erosion was more obvious than those of the viscosity coefficient and fluid density. The drag force had an effect on the principal stresses and the micromechanical arrangement of the sediment grains. The results provide the insights into micro-mechanisms of the onset and erosion of sediment grains.},
